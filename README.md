A place to share your favorite types of wine with your friends.
My application is called Vin-Tracker, and it is a web app for friends to create and share their favorite types of wine with each other. A user creates an account, and can add types of wine to a list, and can then click on any wine on the list and see which one of their friends added that wine. Great for planning parties or for that serious group of wine drinkers!
